# ``db`` folder
- This folder/directory will reload the existing data into the docker container when creating. 
- Export table/database as SQL file for backup in the future. (p/s: make sure there are `CREATE TABLE` and `USE` table_name inside the each file)

### Existing tables from SQL files:
1. ``world`` : dummy database 
2. ``phpmyadmin`` : for enabling the phpmmyadmin advanced features. If not, there will be a warning.
3. ``school_db`` : more dummy database
